Dear Wajih,

I hope my email finds you in good health.

I am saddened by the fact that I will not be able to make it to the 
opening today. I wish you all the best and look forward to working 
with you to build the strongest Syrian Microfinance Insitution, that 
will become a model MFI in the region.

I have thoroughly read the press release which is very well written. I 
usually like for Press Releases to be short and straight to the point, 
although this one is straight to the point we may lose some readers 
half way through the article given its length. That being said, as 
it's the first press release you may have felt obliged to give such 
details.

I wrote some comments directly on the press release, these are only 
suggestions, you are the man on the ground and able to make the proper 
assessments.

Feel free to call me at anytime if you need anything, while in Dubai 
it's preferable that you use my lebanese mobile to contact me (+ 961 
71 192 193).

Best Regards,
Imad Alfadel
