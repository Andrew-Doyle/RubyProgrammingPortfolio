Dear Friend,

I have the honor and confidence to introduce you to this business in view of the fact that you are trustworthy and reliable.

I am Mr.George Eze.

I work in the foreign Payment Department of WEMA BANK PLC LAGOS NIGERIA.

There is an account opened in our bank in 1990 but since 1996 nobody has operated on this account again.

After a private investigation I discovered that the owner of this account was the manager of U.MARTINES CO.LTD - a foreigner who has since died without having a beneficially to this account.

My investigation proved to me also that nobody from the company knows about this account since the company has not become operational.

The amount contained in this account is US$19,780,000 USD.

It is my wish and intention to take this fund abroad for investment.

My colleague and I will need you to set up a new account for this transfer and send to us Or you might send an existing account with no fund in it for us to use.

We will use normal banking proceedure to transfer the fund legally.

I will bring my position and influence to facilitate transfer immediately by legal means.

What we request is absolute secrecy and confidentiality.

And that you will never never disappoint us when fund is transfered to your account.

There is no risk to this business as I will follow the normal banking proceedure.

When this fund is transfered to any account you will provide I will bring all documents used in this process to destroy them in your presence when I come over for my share.

Sharing shall be 20% for you, 75% for me and the remaining 5% to offset any expenses done by each party cause in business every cent spent counts.

Best Regards,
Mr. George Eze.
