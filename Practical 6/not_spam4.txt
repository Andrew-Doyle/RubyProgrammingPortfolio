Hey George, sounds like you're pretty busy. look forward to hearing about
whatever it is you're doing in whatever place you're in. No need to
apologize at all.. i know how crazy things can get. not great timing, but
my parents forcibly bought me a ticket to join them on a resort in puerto
rico, so i already told rodger that i'll need to work offsite at the
beginning of next week. i hope we can set aside time toward the end of the
week to catch up. make sure you're getting some rest
